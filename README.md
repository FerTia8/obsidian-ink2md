# Ink to Markdown - ink2md (Obsidian Plugin)

Convert handwritten notes and images into **clean Markdown** directly inside Obsidian using **Google Gemini OCR/HTR**. Tries to preserve structure and content.

The purpose of this plugin is to bridge the gap between handwritten and typed notes. If, like me, you prefer annotating the old-fashioned way, this plugin lets you bring those notes into Obsidian so you can keep everything in one place and take advantage of Obsidian‚Äôs usual features.

## Features

- OCR/HTR handwritten notes into Markdown  
- Works with images embedded in your vault (`![[note.png]]`)  
- Powered by Google Gemini for high-quality recognition  
- Output is inserted right below the image in your note  

## Installation

### From GitHub Release
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/FerTia8/obsidian-ink2md/releases) page.
2. Download the latest release `.zip`.
3. Extract it into your vault‚Äôs `.obsidian/plugins/` folder.
4. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins**.

### From Source
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Run `npm install && npm run build`.
3. Copy the generated files (`main.js`, `manifest.json`) into your vault‚Äôs `.obsidian/plugins/` folder.
4. Reload Obsidian.

## Setup

This plugin currently supports **Google Gemini API** only. You‚Äôll need an API key, which you can get from official sources. There's a free plan included, ence why it was chosen as the first supported LLM. Then, in Obsidian:

2. Paste your API key into the field.  

## üöÄ Usage

- Select **‚ÄúConvert Ink to Markdown‚Äù**.  
- Wait (few seconds usually).
- The recognized text will appear below the image.  

## Settings

## Development

If you want to hack on this plugin:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FerTia8/obsidian-ink2md

Then reload Obsidian to test.
